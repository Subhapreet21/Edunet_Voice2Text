**Project Title:** Lecture Voice-to-Notes Generator

---

## 1. Introduction

Taking lecture notes manually can be time-consuming and prone to missing key points. This project automates the process of generating lecture notes by using **speech-to-text transcription**, **automatic summarization**, and **flashcard generation** with the help of modern AI models.

The application is built using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface, and leverages **Whisper (OpenAI)** and **Hugging Face Transformers** for natural language processing tasks.

---

## 2. Objectives

* To record or upload lecture audio.
* To transcribe the audio into accurate text.
* To summarize the transcription into concise notes.
* To generate study flashcards (Q&A format) for revision.
* To allow exporting results in multiple formats (TXT, JSON, full report).

---

## 3. System Architecture

**Workflow:**

1. **Audio Input**

   * Users can record live audio or upload lecture files (MP3, WAV, WEBM, M4A).

2. **Transcription (Speech-to-Text)**

   * OpenAI **Whisper** model converts the lecture audio into text.

3. **Summarization**

   * Hugging Face **T5-small** model condenses long transcripts into concise summaries.

4. **Flashcard Generation**

   * Hugging Face **valhalla/t5-small-qg-hl** generates **questions** from key sentences.
   * Original sentences are used as **answers** to form flashcards.

5. **User Interface (Streamlit)**

   * Transcriptions, summaries, and flashcards are displayed.
   * Users can download results in **TXT/JSON** formats or export a full analysis report.
